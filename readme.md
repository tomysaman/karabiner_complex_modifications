# Karabiner-Elements complex modification rules

[Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) is a Mac app that lets you define custom keyboard mappings and layouts. This repository is my personal Karabiner-Elements (KE for short) complex modification rules.

To use, place the json files in `complex_modifications` folder into your KB rules folder below, and then add them in the KE Preferences -> Complex Modifications.

# Documentations

[Karabiner-Elements documentation](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/docs/)

# Notes

If you swap Option key and Command key mapping in your MacOS keyboard setting for KE keyboard ("Karabiner DriverKit VirtualHIDKeyboard"), for KE to trigger Command key you will have to send Option key code, and for KE to trigger Option key you will have to send Command key code. For json files in this repo to work, you should NOT swap CMD and OPT keys.

# FAQs

Q: My changes in json file doesn't work?
> A: KE currently does not have a way to pick up changes in rule json files. You will need to manually remove the rules from within KE and then add them again.

Q: How do I find out my keyboard device vendorID and productID?
> A: Open Karabiner Event Viewer and go to the Device tab, you can find the info there.

Q: Karabiner-Elements does not work on my Bluetooth keyboard?
> A: By default Karabiner Elements is not enabled to control mouse. When a Bluetooth keyboard is connected to a Mac, the connection is usually considered as a combo of keyboard + mouse connection, hence it is not enabled to be controlled by KE by default. You can go to the Preferences -> Deveices and then tick the "modify event" checkbox for the Bluetooth keyboard/connection to enable it.

# My rules

## tomy_base.json
Defines the base rules that useful for any kind of keyboards.
- `CMD` <-> `OPT`
  - Swap Command and Option keys
- `PrtScr` -> Screen capture
  - PrintScreen key does not work in Mac, so we re-define it to bring up Mac built in screen capture tool
- `ScrLck` -> Dictation
  - ScrollLock key does not work in Mac, so we re-define it to start dictation
- `Pause` -> Lock screen
  - Pause/PageBreak key does not work in Mac, so we re-define it to lock your screen

## tomy_hyper.json
Defines the rules for Hyper key which can give you a 2nd layer of keyboard layout for various functionality.

![Hyper key layout](assets/keyboard-layout-editor-hyper-60.jpg)

- `CapsLock` -> `Hyper` = `Ctrl` + `Cmd` + `Opt` + `Shift`
	- Defines CapsLock key as Hyper key (which is Control + Command + Option + Shift)
	- If you hold down CapsLock then you are triggering the Hyper key
	- If you press CapsLock once only (tap it), then it works normally as CapsLock
- `Hyper` + `1` -> `F1`, `Hyper` + `2` -> `F2`, ... `Hyper` + `0` -> `F10`, `Hyper` + `-` -> `F11`, and `Hyper` + `=` -> `F12`
  - Defines F1 - F12 with the number row keys
- `Hyper` + `Esc` -> grave accent `` ` ``
  - A very common 60% keyboard mapping to use Esc key as Delete key
- `Hyper` + `W` `A` `S` `D` -> arrow keys
  - W = Up, A = Left, S = Down, D = Right
- `Hyper` + `I` `J` `K` `L` -> arrow keys
  - I = Up, J = Left, K = Down, L = Right
- `Hyper` + `Q` -> `Home` and `Hyper` + `E` -> `End`
- `Hyper` + `U` -> `Home` and `Hyper` + `O` -> `End`
  - The 2 rules above define the two keys around WASD & IJKL as Home key and End key 
- `Hyper` + `R` -> `PgUp` and `Hyper` + `F` -> `PgDn`
- `Hyper` + `P` -> `PgUp` and `Hyper` + `;` -> `PgDn`
  - The 2 rules above define the two keys on the right side of WASD & IJKL as PageUp key and PageDown key
- `Hyper` + `G` -> `Delete` and `Hyper` + `H` -> `Backspace`
  - This defines the keys next to your "home key markers" (F key and J key) as Delete key and Backspace key, with the one on the left (G key) being Delete key and the one on the right (H key) being Backspace key
- `Hyper` + `Backspace` -> `Delete`
  - A very common 60% keyboard mapping to use Backspace key as Delete key
- `Hyper` + `Z` -> Mute, `Hyper` + `X` -> Volume-, and `Hyper` + `C` -> Volume+
- `Hyper` + `,` -> Mute, `Hyper` + `.` -> Volume-, and `Hyper` + `/` -> Volume+
  - The 2 rules above define the 3 keys to the side of left shift and right shift to be volume controls
- `Hyper` + `V` -> PreviousTrack, `Hyper` + `B` -> Play/Pause, and `Hyper` + `N` -> NextTrack
  - This rules defines the 3 keys below the two "home key markers" (F key and J key) to be media playback controls
- `Hyper` + `[` -> Screen Capture, `Hyper` + `]` -> Start Dictation, and `Hyper` + `\` -> Lock Screen
  - This defines the 3 keys to the right of P key to "works" likes PrintScreen, ScrollLock, and Pause keys. In my base rules they are Screen Capturing key, Start Dictation key, and Lock Screen key respectively
- `Hyper` + `'` -> `Insert`
  - It just makes sense to me to have quote works as Insert key as it is under the ScreenShot `[` , ScrollLock `]`, and PageBreak `\` keys mapping I defined above

## tomy_60_percent.json
Defines rules that useful for 60% and 65% keyboards.
- `Insert` -> `` ` ``
  - Insert key is mapped to grave accent (`) & tilde (~) key
  - Some 65% keyboards have insert key but no grave accent (`) & tilde (~) key. I need this rule as I use grave accent key much more often than insert key.
- `Ctrl` + `Esc` -> `` ` ``
  - Control + ESC to output Grave Accent (`)
  - Instead of FN + ESC to output grave accent (`), which usually need two hands, you can do it with one hand with Ctrl + ESC
- `Shift` + `Esc` -> `~`
  - Shift + ESC to output Tilde (~)
  - This rules is useful when there is no grave accent (`) & tilde (~) key on 60%/65% keyboard. So instead of FN + Shift + Esc to out put tilde you can just use Shift + Esc

# My rules for specific keyboards

## tomy_keychron_k6.json
Defines rules for Keychron K6 65% keyboard
- `Home` -> `` ` ``
  - Home key is mapped to grave accent (`) & tilde (~) key
  - K6 does not have grave accent (`) & tilde (~) key and I need it, so I replace Home key with it.

# My rules when running specific apps

## tomy_remote.json
Defines rules when inside a remote desktop session
- **Notes**
  - These are for when running a remote desktop session in a Windows environment
  - I did not include a rule to swap Command key and Control key, due to I already have a "base" rule that swap Command key and Option key
  - I want my basic Mac text editing keyboard shortcuts to work in Windows
    - Cmd + C, Cmd + V, Cmd + X, Cmd + A are all working by default in Windows Remote Desktop client, so I didn't include them
    - The rules adds Cmd + N, Cmd + S, Cmd + W
- `Cmd` + `N` -> `Ctrl` + `N`
  - Command + N to create a new file/tab
- `Cmd` + `S` -> `Ctrl` + `S`
  - Command + S to save a file
- `Cmd` + `W` -> `Ctrl` + `W`
  - Command + W to close a file/tab
  - This also helps user not to accidentally close remote desktop session
